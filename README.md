## Getting Started

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

setup an .env file for your local database, you can copy the example env file and adapt it. It should not be a problem if you adapted DATABASE_URL does not exist yet, because when first executing, it should be created anyways.

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

seeding you DB:

```bash
npx prisma db seed
```

start Prisma Studio to checkout you DB

```bash
npm run viewDb
```
